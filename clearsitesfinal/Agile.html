<h2>Agile_methodology</h2>

Agile methodology is an approach to project management, typically used in software development. It helps teams respond to the unpredictability of building software through incremental, iterative work cadences, known as sprints. But before discussing agile methodologies further, its best to first turn to the methodology that inspired it: waterfall, or traditional sequential development.
Agile development methodology attempts to provide many opportunities to assess the direction of a project throughout the development lifecycle. This is achieved through regular cadences of work, known as sprints or iterations, at the end of which teams must present a shippable increment of work. Thus by focusing on the repetition of abbreviated work cycles as well as the functional product they yield; agile methodology could be described as iterative and incremental. In waterfall, development teams only have one chance to get each aspect of a project right. In an agile paradigm, every aspect of development which is required or designed is continually revisited throughout the lifecycle. When a team stops and re-evaluates the direction of a project every two weeks, there always time to steer it in another direction.
The Scrum methodology of agile software development marks a dramatic departure from waterfall management. In fact, Scrum and other agile processes were inspired by its shortcomings. The Scrum methodology emphasizes communication and collaboration, functioning software, and the flexibility to adapt to emerging business realities all attributes that suffer in the rigidly ordered waterfall paradigm.
Of all the agile methodologies, Scrum is unique because it introduced the idea of empirical process control. That is, Scrum uses the real-world progress of a project and always the best guess or uninformed forecast to plan and schedule releases. In Scrum, projects are divided into succinct work cadences, known as sprints, which are typically one week, two weeks, or three weeks in duration. At the end of each sprint, stakeholders and team members meet to assess the progress of a project and plan its next steps. This allows a project’s direction to be adjusted or reoriented based on completed work, not speculation or predictions.
Deciding on the method to be used for implementing an IT solution will depend on the size of the project and the technology being used. For C++ projects, the Agile Method is more suitable because the programming language is object orientated and therefore each object can be separately programmed and tested as a separate module. The Agile Method also allows the product to be launched after each stage and, thus, allows extensive testing of each stage. This eliminates bugs in later stages also as these would have been caught in the testing of the earlier stage and eliminated, and the solutions to remove them can be used in all new modules being designed.
In the Waterfall Method, the testing is only done when the completed product is ready and any changes that need to be made as a result means literally rewriting the program. The Waterfall Method can be used when interaction with the customers is limited and instructions for the processes are very clear.
