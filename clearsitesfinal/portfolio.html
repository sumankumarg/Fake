      <p> 
        We were approached to build a multi-tenant application that would allow a wholesale vendor of jewelery and fashion products to manange inventory, orders and shipping while allowing retail vendors to sell these products through their own e-commerce portals. The retail e-commerce portals needed to behave like completely independent websites with their own customised look and feel.
      </p> 
      <p> 
        The solution implemented by us uses REST (or more precisely, POX) to allow any client that has an API key to use the wholesale application's API to list products, create a shopping cart and place orders. Retail e-commerce portals are implemented as web applications that consume the wholesale API, allowing us to spin up new, fully functional retail websites in under thirty minutes.

      <blockquote>C42 has been amazing to work with. I've worked primarily with Aakash for the last 3 months, and have been really impressed. He is a rockstar engineer, maintains open channels of communication at all times and demonstrates a strong sense of ownership. Not only does he ensure that the implementation closely matches the business needs, but he also thinks through the user flow and makes great recommendations to improve the overall experience. I’ve also interacted to a limited extent with the rest of the team, and their values strongly mirror what I’ve seen with Aakash. I trust C42 completely with my product.</blockquote>

      <div class="highlight">Project Description</div> 
      <p>It is currently complicated and cumbersome to plan amazing international vacations. CleverBootz is going to change that. Their goal is to make the planning every bit as fun as the actual trip by re-thinking the process of international vacation planning as a fun, social experience.</p> 
      <p>CleverBootz approached us with 4 wireframes, a 2 page requirements document, a solid business plan and an amazing business team. It has been a roller coaster journey since then: while the overall goal was to deliver a prototype, things weren't that straightforward. The requirements changed a lot as we learned more about our users and the travel ecosystem on multiple continents. Using Rails and XP practices we were able to provide an environment where these changes could be accommodated really easily resulting in a prototype that was well received by customers on a tight schedule. We are continuing to work with CleverBootz as they build out their product.</p>

Having explored various outsourcing options within and outside Bangalore, I can say that such talent & workmanship is extremely hard to find in Indian tech consulting companies. Good luck to the C42 folks, ahead.</blockquote>
