      <p>Nikhil, since he wrote his first BASIC program at the age of eight on a '386, has always been fascinated by computers and programming.
      While he has an engineering degree in Electronics and Communication, he has actively pursued his childhood passion for Computers, Physics, History, Mythology and Cognitive Science. 
      He was introduced into the Agile paradigm during his one year stint at ThoughtWorks.
      </p>
      <p>
      He strongly believes that todays technological leaps in computing and communication hold great potential 
      and lets his instinct for simplicity and perfection drive his programmatic design. 
      He hopes to change the world by crafting people centered software.
      </p>
      <p>
      If he wasn't programming he would be studying History, analyzing the mind, mentoring children and/or coming up with ways to make this world a nicer place. 
      Nikhil spends his spare time reading, contemplating the past, discovering people and analyzing life. His idea of recreation is to ride away from civilization on his bike.
