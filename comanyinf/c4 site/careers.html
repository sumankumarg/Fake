    <h3>programmer</h3>
    <p>We are currently looking for programmers, the kind that write code because they like it. If you enjoy crafting beautifully designed, elegant code, please do consider <a href="mailto:work@c42.in" class="email">joining us</a>. Ruby experience is <span class="emphasis">not</span> mandatory.</p>
    <p>There are several things that characterise the kind of people we'd love to work with. If you do some, or all of the things in the following list and are looking for a new place to work, we're likely to get along well.</p>
    <ul class="patterns">

      <li>You care about writing code, and writing it well</li>
      <li>You are a polyglot programmer and are comfortable with several programming languages</li>
      <li>You test drive all your code</li>
      <li>You are familiar with eXtreme Programming (XP)</li>
      <li>You contribute to open source projects</li>
      <li>You love learning, and take pleasure in getting better at what you do</li>

      <li>You want to work with like minded, intelligent people you can have a real conversation with</li>
      <li>You aren't overly fond of conformity, especially in the context of being a faceless cog in a big company</li>
      <li>You value decency and integrity, and prefer working with other people who do so too</li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
    <p>People who come across us for the first time have a few standard questions. Here's a quick FAQ listing the things we're often asked:</p>
    <ul class="faq">

      <li class="question">Q. Do I need to know Ruby?</li>
      <li class="answer">A. It helps, but isn't essential. We're far more interested in you as a programmer than as a <span class="emphasis">ruby</span> programmer. A good programmer can always learn a new language and pair-programming accelerates the process greatly.</li>
      <li class="question">Q. I'm not sure I have enough (or the right kind of) experience for the kind of work you do.</li>
      <li class="answer">A. This is always a valid concern, but it never hurts to avoid assumptions and talk things over. Get in touch with us and we can figure things out.</li>
      <li class="question">Q. I'm fresh out of college with no work experience and am looking for my first job.</li>

      <li class="answer">A. We don't usually interview or hire fresh graduates, but if you've been hacking code since you were little, have several personal projects outside of college work or have contributed to open source then we'd love to speak with you. We aren't particular about your marks nor do we require that you have a CS background.</li>
      <li class="question">Q. I have financial commitments and can't afford the salary cuts that moving to a startup often entails.</li>
      <li class="answer">A. Who said anything about salary cuts? We pay, and pay well. Not as well as, say, Google, but definitely above the industry average.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>We do understand that this is a rather eccentric job description and slightly vague to boot, but more traditional descriptions don't seem to work too well for us. If you like what you see, please just drop us a note at <a href="mailto:work@c42.in" class="email">work@c42.in</a> and we'd be happy to discuss stuff with you.
